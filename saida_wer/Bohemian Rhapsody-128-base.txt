 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Court in the land slide? No escape from reality. Open your eyes, Look up to the skies as sea. I'm just too cruel for a tiny ghost, Because I'm easy-cup, Easy-goer, Little high, little lord. Any way the wind blows, Doesn't really matter to me. Mama, just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, Oh, Did lead to make you cry, If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, Carry on, carry on, If there's nothing really matters. Too late, My time has come, Stent you as dark as the body, Body's aching all the time, Goodbye everybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind a place to go. Mama, I don't wanna lie, Sometimes wish I'd never been more than old. Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, I see a little silhouette of a man, Scaramush, Scaramush, Will you do the band and go? Scam the boats at lightning, Very very frighteningly, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scali, Scam the boats I see. I see if I fail, I'm so surprised. Just gain or lose? Come away forever, oh, Mama, I see how your darling, of me, of me So you think you can stop me, you spin by I So you think you can love me and live me to die Oh baby Can't do this to me baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here Oh baby Nothing really matters, anyone can't see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
