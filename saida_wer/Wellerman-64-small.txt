 There once was a ship that put to sea The name of the ship was a bully of tea The winds blew up her bird up down below My bully boys blow Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go She'd not been two weeks from shore When down on her a right whale bore The captain called all hands and swore He'd take that whale in tow Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go Before the boat had hit the water The whale still came up and caught her Hands to the side, her pinned and fought her When she dived down low Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go No line was cut, no whale was freed The captain's mane was not of greed And he belonged to the whelman's creed She took that ship in tow Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go For forty days or even more The lane went slack, then take once more All boats were lost, there were only four But still the whel did go Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go As far as our fear, the fight's still on The lane's not cut, no whale's not gone The willa man makes a regular call To encourage the captain crew and go Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go Soon may the walla man come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tunnel is done We'll take a leave and go
