 There once was a ship that put to sea The name of the ship was a bully of tea The winds blew up her bow, dipped down, oh below my bully boy's blow Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue-in-is-done We'll take a leave and go She had not been two weeks from shore When down on her a right whale bore The captain called all hands and swore He'd take the whale in tow Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue-in-is-done We'll take a leave and go Da-da-da-da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da-da Before the boat had hit the water The whale's sail came up and caught her All hands to the side, harping and fodder When she dived down low Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue-in-is-done We'll take a leave and go No line was cut, no whale was freed The captain's mind was not of greed And he belonged to the whaleman's creed She took that ship in tow Soon may the wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da For forty days or even more The line went slack and tight once more Oh boats were lost there were only four But still that whale did go Soon may the wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go His fires off hair, the fight's still on The line's not cut and the whale's not gone The Wellerman makes his regular call To encourage the Captain crew and all Soon may the Wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go Soon may the Wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go
