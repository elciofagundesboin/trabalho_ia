 Kiss me hard before you go, some of time's sad and lose. I just wanted you to know that baby you're the best. I got my red dress on tonight, dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight. Throw my hair up real big, beauty queen style, high heels off, I'm feeling alive. Oh my god, I feel it in the air, telephone lines above, on stairs when I can smell honey. I'm tired, I feel it everywhere, nothing scares me anymore. Kiss me hard before you go, some of time's sad and lose. I just wanted you to know that baby you're the best. I got my summer time, summer time's sad and lose. I'm feeling electric tonight, cruising down the coast going about 99. Got my bad baby by my heavenly side, I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight. Oh my god, I feel it in the air, telephone lines above, on stairs when I can smell honey. I'm tired, I feel it everywhere, nothing scares me anymore. Kiss me hard before you go, some of time's sad and lose. I just wanted you to know that baby you're the best. I got my summer time, summer time's sad and lose. I'm going to miss you forever, like the stars we put on in the morning sky. Way less better than ever, even if you're gone, I'm gonna die. I got that summer time, summer time's sadness. Summer time, summer time's sadness. Got that summer time, summer time's sadness, oh, oh, oh. Kiss me hard before you go, some of time's sad and lose. I just wanted you to know that baby you're the best. I got that summer time, summer time's sadness. Thanks for watching!
