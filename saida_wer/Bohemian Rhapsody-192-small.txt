 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide? No escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no strength because I'm easy cub, easy gore Little high, little low, anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead Mama, life had just begun, but now I've got it thrown it all away Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry? If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, cause nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, since shivers die my spine Body's aching all the time, goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, did lead to make you cry? If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouetto of a man, skarabush, skarabush, will you do the pandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Gally-lay-o, gally-lay-o, gally-lay-o, big-a-ro, my little boy I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family, spare him his life from this one small city Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah, no, you will not let you go Mama, mia, mama, mia, mama, mia, let me go The elder book has a devil for the sack, for me, for me, for me So you think you can stop me and spit my eyes So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me Baby, raise your hand
