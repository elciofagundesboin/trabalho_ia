 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Court in a landslide? No escape from reality? Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just too cool up on the North side Because I'm easy-cup, easy-goer, little high, little lower Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger now he's dead, mama, life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, there's nothing really matters Too late, my time is gone Since she was down by somebody bodies aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go, gotta leave you all behind a place to choose Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow I see a little silhouette of a man Scaramush, that a mush will you do the band and go? Thunderbows are lightning, very very frightening Call me Leo, call me Leo, call me Leo, call me Leo, call me Leo, call me Leo He's just a poor boy from a poor family, spare him his life on this once-in-a-tay Easy-cup, easy-goer, will you let me go? Let me go, let me go, let me go Mama, me, I'm a man, me, I'm a man, me, I let me go Thunderbows are a devil, but aside from me, or me, or me So you think you can stop me, you spit my eyes, so you think you can love me and live me safe Oh, baby, can't you miss me, baby, just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here Oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby Nothing remains, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
