 There once was a ship that put to see the name of the ship was a belly of tea The winds blew up her by her adaptable old my belly boys blow Soon they go while I'm on com the ring of sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue and his tongue will take her even more She not been to ex from shore and earn on her right will bore the captain called All the hands and sword he'd take their will into Soon they go while I'm on com the ring of sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue and his tongue will take her even more Before the board had hit the water the way else it came up and got her hands to decide how I pinned in the water when she died in the water. Soon may the well-a-man come to bring a sugar and tea and rum one day when the tonning is done. No-layne was cut. No-will was freed. The captain's main was not of greed and he belonged to the will and the screech. He took that ship into. Soon may the well-a-man come to bring a sugar and tea and rum one day when the tonning is done. We'll take our leave and go. Put it down. For four days or even more the lane went slack and take one small or butts were lost. They were wrongly four but still the the will did go. Soon may the well-a-man come to bring a sugar and tea and rum one day when the tonning His fun will take a leave and go His fires of hairline, the fate still on The links not got and the wheels not gone The willaman makes his regular coat To encourage the captain crew and go Soon may the willaman come The bringer sugar and tea and roam One day when the time in his done will take a leave and go Soon may the willaman come The bringer sugar and tea and roam One day when the time in his done will take a leave and go
