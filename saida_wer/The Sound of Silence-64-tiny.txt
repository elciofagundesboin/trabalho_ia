 Hello Darkness My Ophrine. I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping, and love vision that was planted in my brain, still in me, within the town of silence, and in restless dreams I walked along. Now the streets are closed long. Even though the days keep away, I turn my heart to the cold and down, when my eyes must fail by the flesh of a neon light, the split behind me, and catch the sound of silence, and in the naked light I saw, 10,000 people may be more, people talking without speaking, people hearing without listening, people writing stones, that voices never share, no wonder, just good for sound, of silence, who said I'd do not know, silence like a cancer grow, in my words that I might keep you, take my arms that I might reach you, but my words like silent, were in your arms felt. I can't go anywhere, I'm so close, I'm silent, and when people bow and pray, during the uncapping day, and the sun breaks out in its morning, in the words that it was for me, and the sun said the words of the promise I written, on the subway wall, tantoment howl and the words flows. $还 long? $还 long? $还 long?
