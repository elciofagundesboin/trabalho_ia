 There once was a ship that put to sea The name of the ship was a bully of tea The winds blew up her bow, dipped down, oh below my bully boys blow Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue in his band will take a leave and go She had not been two weeks from shore When down on her a right whale bore The captain called all hands and swore he'd take the whale in tow Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue in his band will take a leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Before the boat had hit the water The whale sail came up and caught her All hands to the side harping and fodder When she dived down low Soon may the wellerman come To bring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue in his band will take a leave and go No lane was cut, no whale was freed The captain's main was not of greed And he belonged to the whaleman's creed She took that ship in tow Soon may the wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go dah dah dah dah dah dah dah Dici half of the escapes For forty days or even more The lane went slack, then tight once more All boats were lost, there were only four But still the whale did go Soon may the wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go As far as I've heard, the fight's still on The line's not cut and the whale's not gone The Wellerman makes his regular call To encourage the captain crew and all Soon may the Wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go Soon may the Wellerman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go
