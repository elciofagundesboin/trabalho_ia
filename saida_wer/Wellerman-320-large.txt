 There once was a ship that put to sea The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea The winds blew up her bow Dipped down all below, my bully boys blow Soon may the will o' man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go She had not been two weeks from shore When down on her a right whale bore The captain called all hands and swore He'd take that whale in tow Soon may the will o' man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Before the boat had hit the water The whalesail came up and caught her Hands to the side, harping then fought her When she dived down low Soon may the well-a-man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go No line was cut, no will was freed The captain's mind was not of greed And he belonged to the wellman's creed She took that ship in tow Soon may the well-a-man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da For forty days or even more The line went slack and tight once more All boats were lost, there were only four But still that whale did go Soon may the well-a-man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go As far as affair, the fight's still on The line's not cut and the whale's not gone The well-a-man makes his regular call To encourage the captain crew and though Soon may the well-a-man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go Soon may the well-a-man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go
