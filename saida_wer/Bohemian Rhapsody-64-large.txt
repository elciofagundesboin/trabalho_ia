 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a fool boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama, life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, sent shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go, gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, I don't wanna die, sometimes wish I'd never been born at all Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the bandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Pigaro, Magnifico I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family, sparing his life on this one atrocity Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
