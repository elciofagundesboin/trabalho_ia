 There once was a ship that put to sea The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea The winds blew up her bow Dipped down all below, my bully boys blow Soon may the will o' man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go She had not been two weeks from shore When down on her a right whale bore The captain called all hands and swore He'd take that whale in tow Soon may the will o' man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Before the boat had hit the water The whale sail came up and caught her All hands to the side, harping in fodder When she dived down low Soon may the will o' man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go No line was cut, no whale was freed The captain's mane was not of greed And he belonged to the whaleman's creed She took that ship in tow Soon may the whaleman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take our leave and go Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Da da da da da da da da da da da da For forty days or even more The line went slack and tight once more All boats were lost, there were only four But still the whale did go Soon may the whaleman come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take our leave and go His fires are fair, the fight's still on The line's not cut and the whale's not gone The Willa Man makes his regular call To encourage the Captain crew and oh Soon may the Willa Man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go Soon may the Willa Man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day when the tonguin' is done We'll take a leave and go
