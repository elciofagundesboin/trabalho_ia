 Hello darkness my old friend, I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked along Now the streets are cobblestone Near the middle of a streetlight I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stale By the flash of a neon light I spent the night and touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw 10,000 people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs That voices never share No one did Disgusting sounds of silence Foods that I do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell And echo near the will of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign blacked out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said the words of the prophets Are written on the subway walls The tenement halls whispered the sounds of silence
