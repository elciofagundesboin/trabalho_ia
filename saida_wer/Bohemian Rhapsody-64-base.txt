 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Court in the land slide? No escape from reality. Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see. I'm just too good for a party, No one's there because I'm easy-cup. Easy-goer, Little high, Little Lord, Any way to win, Rose, That's a really better to me. Mama, Just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger knife, He's dead. Mama, Life had just begun, But now a gun is thrown at all this way. Mama, Didn't mean to make you cry, If I'm not back again, It's time to battle. Carry on, carry on, Nothing really matters. Too late, My time has come, Then she was down by somebody, Body's aching all the time, Goodbye everybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind a place to go. Mama, I don't wanna lie, Sometimes wish I've never been bored at all. Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, I see a little silhouette of a man, Skarabou, Skarabou, Will you do the band-and-go?
