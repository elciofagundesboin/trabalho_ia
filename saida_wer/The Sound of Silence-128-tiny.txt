 Hello, darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping, and love the young, that was planted in my brain, still in me, within the soul of silence, in restless dreams I walked along. Now the streets are closed on, neither me nor me, street by, I turned my collar to the cold and down, when my eyes were still, by the clash of any own light, it's with the night, and touch the sound of silence, and in the naked ladder saw, 10,000 people may be more, people talking without speaking, people hearing without listening, people writing songs, that voices never share, no one did, just could have a sound, but silent, full set eye you do not know, silence like a cancer grow, here my words that I might teach you, take arms that I might teach you, but my words like silent, and your arms felt, echoing in the wind, of silence, and in the people down, praying, during the uncaughting day, and the sound back had its warning, in the words that it was for me, and the signs said the words of the promise are written, this summer dark but cold, we trying to impose the appropriate decisions for them, those say lambs mespieces of the moment, Rosenblas who always of silence?
