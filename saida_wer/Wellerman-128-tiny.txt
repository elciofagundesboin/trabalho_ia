 There once was a ship that put to see the name of the ship was a belly of tea The winds blew up her by her adaptable old my belly boys blow Soon they go while I'm on com the ring of sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue and his tongue will take her even more She not been to ex from shore and earn on her right will bore the captain called All the hands in sorely ticked a railing tool Soon they go while I'm on com the ring of sugar and tea and rum One day when the tongue and his tongue will take her even more Daraerara, daaraerara... Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Before the board had hit the water the wheel Still came up and caught her, and stood a side-harp and then fodder when she died in the war. Soon may the well-a-man come to bring us sugar and tea and rum. One day when the tunnel is done, we'll take her leave and go. No lane was cut, no ill was freed, the captain's main was not of greed, and he belonged to the well-man's creature, took that ship into. Soon may the well-a-man come to bring us sugar and tea and rum. One day when the tunnel is done we'll take her leave and go. Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da. For forty days or even more the lane was like, and take one more, Oh but twirl lost there were only four but still let the will did go. Soon neither will I mancomned the bringer sugar and tea and rum One day when the time it is done we'll take a leave and go. As far as a fair, the fate still on the links not got and no wheels not gone The will I man makes as regular coat to encourage the captain crew and though Soon neither will I mancomned the bringer sugar and tea and rum One day when the time it is done we'll take a leave and go. Soon neither will I mancomned the bringer sugar and tea and rum One day when the time it is done we'll take a leave and go.
