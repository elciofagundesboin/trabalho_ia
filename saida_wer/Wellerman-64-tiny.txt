 There once was a ship that put to see the name of the ship was a belly of tea The wind blew up her by her adaptorable old my belly boys blow Soon they go while I'm on com the ring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the time is unmilled take on even more She not been to ex from shore and earn on her right will bore a captain called All the onions were all taken there willing to Soon me the one I'm on com the ring my sugar and tea and rum One day when the time is unmilled take on even more Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Before the board had hit the water the will still came up and quarter And that I say it, I'm a pendant for her, which she died of the Lord. Soon may the well-a-man come, the bring us sugar and tea, and wrong. One day when a tonning is done, we'll take her leave and go.

Soon may the willaman come the bring us sugar and tea and mom One day when the time is done we'll take our even go As far as a fair, the fate still on the wings not got And the wheels not gone the willaman makes such regular call To encourage the captain crew and all Soon may the willaman come the bring us sugar and tea and mom One day when the time is done we'll take our even go Soon may the willaman come the bring us sugar and tea and mom One day when the time is done we'll take our even go
