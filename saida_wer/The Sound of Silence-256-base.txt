 Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left it seeds while I was sleeping And a vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the cell of silence In restless streams I walked alone Now the streets are closed on New familiar old days street by I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of any own life It's split the night and touch the sound of silence And then they'll make it let us all 10,000 people may be more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs That voices never share No one did Disgusting the sound of silence Fools that I do not know Silence like a cancer rose Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell Echoing the world of silence And the people bowed and prayed To a young God they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was for me And the signs said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls Ten of them are always whispered in the sounds of silence
