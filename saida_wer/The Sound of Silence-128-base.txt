 Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left it seeds while I was sleeping And a vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the cell of silence In restless streams I walked alone Now the streets are closed on New familiar waves, street winds I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of any own life It's with the night And touched the sound of silence And it will make it let us all 10,000 people may be more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs That voices never share No one did Disgur the sound of silence Fools that I do not know Silence like a cancer rose Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent raindrops fell Echoing the waves of silence And the people bow and pray To a young God they made And the sign backed out its warning In the words that it was warning And the signs said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls Ten of them are always whispered in the sounds of silence
