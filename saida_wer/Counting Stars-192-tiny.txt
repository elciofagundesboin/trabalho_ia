 Lately I've been not losing sleep Dreaming about the things we could be But baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Yeah we'll be counting stars I see this light like a swinging vines Swing my heart across the line in my face this fashion signs Seek it out and you shall find a hole but I'm not that old young But I'm not that bold and I don't think the world is so old I'm just going what we told I feel something so right I don't belong to you I feel something so wrong I'm doing what I've been in I could lie, could lie, could lie everything that kills me Makes me feel alive Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars I feel alive and I feel it burn down this river Every time the hope is out for let it work Make that money watch it burn Oh, let them out that old young But I'm not that bold and I don't think the world is so old I'm just going what we told I feel something so wrong I'm doing what I've been in I could lie, could lie, could lie Everything that rounds me makes me want to play Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Oh, let them out that old young But I'm not that bold and I don't think the world is so old I'm just going what we told I feel alive and I feel it burn down this river Every time the hope is out for let it work Make that money watch it burn down this river Every time the hope is out for let it work Makes me feel alive Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Baby I've been not been listening Dreaming about the things we could be Baby I've been not been praying hard So no more counting dollars will be counting stars Oh, let them watch it burn down this river Every time the hope is out for let it work Make that money watch it burn down this river Every time the hope is out for let it work Make that money watch it burn down this river
