 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide? No escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no strength because I'm easy cub, easy go Little high, little low, anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead Mama, life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, did need to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on, said nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, since she was died my spine, body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go, gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, I don't wanna die, sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouette of a man, skarabush, skarabush, will you do the pandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me Gally lay yo, gally lay yo, gally lay yo, pick up a little boy I'm just a blue boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy, from a poor family, spare him his life from his worst atrocity Easy cub, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah, no, we will not let you go, let him go Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go Bismillah, no, we will not let you go, let him go Bismillah, no, we will not let you go, let him go Mama, mama, mía, mama, mía, mama, mía, let me go Sviya, zidduk, has a devil for a side for me, oh me, oh me So you think you can stop me and spit my eyes So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, can't do this to me baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me Baby, why do you have me?
