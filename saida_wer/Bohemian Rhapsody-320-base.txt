 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Court in a landslide? No escape from reality? Open your eyes, Look up to the skies as sea! I'm just too cruel for a tiny ghost, Because I'm easy-cup, Easy-goer, Little high, little lore, Anywhere the wind blows, Doesn't really matter to me, To me, Mama, Just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger, now he's dead, Mama, Life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away, Mama, Did lead to making cry, If I'm not back again this time, Tomorrow, carry on, carry on, There's nothing really matters, Too late, My time has come, Since she was down by somebody, Body's aching all the time, Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go, Gotta leave you all behind a place, It's the truth, Mama, I don't wanna lie, Sometimes wish I'd never been more than old, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, I see a little silhouette of a man Scaramoush, that a bush will you do the band and go Thunderbolts are lightning, very very frightening Beans Calli leo, calli leo Calli leo, pick a home Magnifico I'm just a crow for nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family He's sparing his life on this once-in-a-tree Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? This millah, no! We will not let you go Let him go, we will not let you go Let him go, we will not let you go Let me go, let me go, let me go Let me go, let me go Oh, mama mia, mama mia Let me go, we will not let you go As a devil, put aside for me For me, for me So you think you can snow, be a sprained by aile So you think you can love me and leave me sick by aile Oh, baby Can't do this to me, baby I'm just gonna get out, just gonna get right out of here Oh, mama mia Nothing really matters, anyone can't see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me
