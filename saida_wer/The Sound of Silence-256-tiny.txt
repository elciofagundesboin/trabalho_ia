 Hello, darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again, because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping, and love vision that was planted in my brain, still remains within the soul of silence, and restless dreams I walked along. Now the streets are closed on. Neither will I be street-bound, I turn my heart to the cold and down, when my eyes were still, by the clash of any own light, the split between night and touch the sound of silence, and in the naked light I saw, 10,000 people may be more, people talking without speaking, people hearing without listening, people writing songs, that voices never share, no one did, just could have a sound of silence, food said I'd do not know, silence like a cancer grow, here my words that I might teach you, take forms that I might teach you, but my words like silent rain drops bell, you know well of silence, and with people downgrade, during the uncaughtly main, and my signback had its warning, in the words that it was for me, and my sign said the words of the promise are written, Someone said where you are You tell them in case Where's my little sounds Osilands
