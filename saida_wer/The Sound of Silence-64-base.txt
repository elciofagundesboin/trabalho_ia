 Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because evision softly creeping Left it seeds while I was sleeping And evision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Now the streets are closed on New familiar days dreamt when I turned my collar to the cold end When my eyes were spared by the pleasure of any own life It's with the night and comes the sound of silence And in the make it let us all 10,000 people may be more People talking without speaking Before hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share No one did The scurvy sound of silence Who said I do not know Silence like a cancer rose Give my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silence The rain drops down And the wind blows outside And the people bow and pray To a young God they made And the sign backed out in its warning In the words that it was warning And the signs said the words of the prophets are written on the subway wall Ten of them all whispered in the sounds of silence
