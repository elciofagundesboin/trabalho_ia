 Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked along. Now the streets of Cobblestone Leave the middle of a streetland. I turn my collar to the cold and damp. When my eyes were stared by the flash of a neon light. I split the night and touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more. People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening. People writing songs that voices never share. No one did. Just heard the sound of silence. Who said I do not know? Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you. Take my arms that I might reach you. But my words like silent raindrops fell. An echo in the will of silence. And the people bowed in praise To the neon god they made. And the sign cracked out its warning. In the words that it was forming. And the signs said the words of the prophets are written on the subway wall. The tenement hall displays the sounds of silence.
