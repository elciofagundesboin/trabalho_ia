 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide? No escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy cub, easy gore, little high, little low Anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama, life had just begun, but now I've got it thrown it all away Mama, ooh, did mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on Cause if nothing really matters Too late, my time has come, since she was dying last night Body's aching all the time, goodbye everybody, I've got to go, gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, did mean to make you cry, I don't wanna die Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouetto of a man, skarabush, skarabush, will you do the pandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Gally, lay-o, gally, lay-o, gally, lay-o, pig, I'm a li-pig-o I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family, sparing his life from his ones ross and tea Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah, no, we will not let you go Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go The Elzibook has a devil born aside from me, from me, from me So you think you can stop me and spit my eyes So you think you can love me and leave me to die, oh baby Can't do this to me baby, just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah Baby, why don't you let me go?
