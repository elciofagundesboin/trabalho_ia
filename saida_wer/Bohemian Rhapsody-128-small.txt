 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide? No escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no strength Because I'm easy cub, easy gore, little high, little low Anywhere the wind blows doesn't really matter to me Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, cause nothing really matters Too late, my time has come Since she was down last night, body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry I don't wanna die, sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouette of a man Scaramush, will you do the pandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Galileo, I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Sparing his life on this one's own city Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? Bismillah, no, you will not let you go Mama, me, I, let me go The elder book has a devil for the sight of me So you think you can stop me and spit my eyes So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me Baby, why the way you look?
