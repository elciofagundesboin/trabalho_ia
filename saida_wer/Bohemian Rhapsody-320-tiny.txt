Can't hold a time Goodbye, everybody I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind a place Oh, oh, oh I don't want to die From time to time Never been born Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Nothing really matters Did he want chance? Nothing really matters Nothing really matters To me Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
