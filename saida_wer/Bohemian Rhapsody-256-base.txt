 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Court in a landslide? No escape from reality? Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see I'm just too cool up on the North side Because I'm easy-cup, easy-goer Little high, little lower Any way the wind blows Doesn't really matter to me Mama, just killed a man Put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger now he's dead Mama, life had just begun But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, who did lead to make you cry? If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, because there's nothing really matters Too late, my time is gone Since she was down by somebody, bodies aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind a place to choose Mama, who did it? I don't wanna lie Sometimes wish I'd never been bored at all I see a little silhouette of a man Scaram-oosh, where a moosh will you do the band-and-go? Thunderbolts are lightning, very very frightening Calli leo, calli leo Calli leo, calli leo, pick a room I'm just too cool for anybody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family He's fair and is like a mischievous boss to take Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? This milla, no, you will not let you go Let him go, this milla, we will not let you go Let him go, this milla, we will not let you go Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, let me go Go, be yourself as a devil for the sight from me For me, for me So you think you can snow me a spik by ice So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, can't do this to me baby So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby Nothing really matters, anyone can see Nothing really matters Nothing really matters to me So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby This milla, no, you will not let you go
