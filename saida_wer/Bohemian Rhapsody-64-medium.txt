Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a blue boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me To me Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head Pulled my trigger, now he's dead Mama, life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on Because if nothing really matters Too late, my time has come Sent shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry I don't want to die, sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouetto of a man Scaramouche, will you do the bandango? Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Piccaro Magnifico, I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family Sparing his life from this monstrosity Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
